## news-api-kafka-producer-consumer

An ETL setup has been established where the data from news-API has been imported for the keyword jobs and loaded into a CSV file thatâ€™s loaded into the hive table via hdfs. The loaded data is further used to extract insights, most said words, day-wise distribution of news articles, and so on.
